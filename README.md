How to build Chinwag
======

Chinwag is built on Sproutcore. Easiest way to get it is by using [Gem](https://rubygems.org/).

`sudo gem install sproutcore` (This takes a while, go get a coffee.)

Check out the project using `git clone --recursive` (to check out submodules as well).

Once that's done, navigate to the root directory of the project and use `sproutcore server`. The server will start on port 4020.
